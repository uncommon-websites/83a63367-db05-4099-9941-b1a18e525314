    "prompt": "Environmental portrait: A professional marketing manager (age 30-40, diverse) stands confidently at a modern office desk in a bright, open SaaS workspace. The office features clean lines, glass partitions, and subtle indigo or cyan accent details. The manager is mid-celebration—perhaps with a raised fist, genuine smile, or sharing a light moment with a nearby colleague. Lighting is soft, cool, and evenly diffused from large windows, with no harsh shadows. The color palette is desaturated with cool neutrals and brand-aligned pops of indigo or cyan. Composition uses the rule of thirds, with 30% negative space to one side for openness. The mood is energized but focused, conveying capability and purposeful momentum. Editorial documentary style, natural and authentic, with a Stripe-Linear sophistication. No screens, text, or abstract elements present.",
